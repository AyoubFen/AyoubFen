Hi, I'm Fenkouch Ayoub, I'm a quant consultant. 
 
 - I'm interested in **quantitative finance**, **stochastic and statistical models**, **numerical analysis** and all related topics. 
 - I code in this repository mainly for fun/learning/curiosity, but could be interested in more serious projects in the future, if time allows.
 - I code mainly in **C#** and **Python** (occasionally **C++**).
 - If you notice an error or optimization idea in any of my projects, please inform me : **afenkouch@gmail.com**
